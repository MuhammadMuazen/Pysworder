# Pysworder
Simple Python script that generates a random password and strengthen a weak provided password
#NIST Special Publication 800-63B: Digital Identity Guidelines (United States):
1. Passwords should have a minimum length of at least 8 characters
2. Longer passwords are generally stronger; encourage the use of passphrases, which are easier to remember and can be longer.
3. Passwords should not be composed of easily guessable information, such as dictionary words, common phrases, or patterns (e.g., "password123").
4. Avoid using information that can be easily obtained or guessed, such as usernames, birthdays, or common patterns (e.g., "12345").
5. Encourage a mix of character types, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
6. Avoid password expiration policies that force users to change their passwords regularly without reason, as they can lead to weaker passwords.
7. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible to enhance security.
